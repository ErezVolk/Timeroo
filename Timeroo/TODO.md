#  TODO List
- "About" dialog with version
- Support iOS? But what for?
- Calculator-like "MS/MR" (and save to storage)
- Find a way to make this scriptable (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72990743/making-swiftui-app-scriptable-with-applescript-and-javascript-jxa didn't work, maybe I'm missing something)
